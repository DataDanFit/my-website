Hi! I am Dan. I am an analytics professional and Liverpool fan, from the north-west of England. 

I enjoy acquiring knowledge through exploring and analysing data. Data is essential for reaching the truth and supporting decision-making, which is the primary pupose of data science and analytics.

My key skills include data analysis, visualisation, modelling and wrangling; machine learning, and dashboard design.
